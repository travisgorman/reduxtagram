6. All about Redux Actions
	* actions are like JavaScript events
	* actions return objects with 2 important things
		- the type (name of action)
		- and a payload of information that is acted upon

7. All about Redux Reducers
	* reducers are what updates state (with the action)
	* reducers take 2 arguments:
		- the action
		- and current copy of state
	* **returns** an updated copy of state

8. Integrating our store with React Router
	* The `Provider` gives it's children access to `store`
	*

	* only components can be hot reloaded
	* `Provider.store.dispatch` is the method that runs actions
  * every reducer runs when an action is dispatched
  * use switch statements to determine what affects state
